/***********************************
 * Mario-1
 * In the original Super Mario Brothers game at the end of nearly every level
 * Mario would scale a pyramid and jump from the top to reach a flagpole.
 *
 * Your mission is to write a program to simulate the construction of that pyramid 
 * using hashtags (#) for the blocks. 
 *
 * Later you will get input from the user to determine exactly how high the pyramid
 * should be built but for now, assume a height of 10.
 * 
 * Lastly, the top of the pyramid should extend for two columns an example is shown below.
 * Height 4 pyramid:
 *
 *     ##
 *    ###
 *   ####
