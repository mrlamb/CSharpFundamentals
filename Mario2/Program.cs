/***********************************
 * Mario-2
 * In the original Super Mario Brothers game at the end of nearly every level
 * Mario would scale a pyramid and jump from the top to reach a flagpole.
 *
 * Your mission is to write a program to simulate the construction of that pyramid 
 * using hashtags (#) for the blocks. 
 *
 * Further you will query the user for how tall the pyramid should be. Your input should look
 * like this:
 *
 * Height? (user input goes here)
 * 
 * You will then build the pyramid using the input number. I have included a function to help
 * ease into this aspect of the program. You may use the GetInt() method to retrieve an integer 
 * from the user. This method handles error checking for you and is just meant to abstract that 
 * portion back temporarily.
 * 
 * Lastly, the top of the pyramid should extend for two columns an example is shown below.
 * Height 4 pyramid:
 *
 *     ##
 *    ###
 *   ####
 *  #####
